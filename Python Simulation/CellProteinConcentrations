RrcFDFNR:float = 1          #21,3 (uM/s) Roles of Ferredoxin-NADP+ Oxidoreductase and Flavodoxin in NAD(P)H-Dependent Electron Transfer Systems. I think this value describes the rate of NADPH formation through FNR. It might not be what the variable name says.
There should also be a reverse reactio which creates a different kind of FdFNR.
There might actually be two types of this and three types of Fd.

Fd1, Fd2, Fd3. Whit the index marking their reduction and oxidation state. the third state might be the neutral configuration

Furthermore, FNR definitely hast three states. And Fd maybe only two after all. But FNR, there it is. Three states, and several functions.

FdRED: Reduced Fd
FdNEU: Neutral Fd
FdOX: Oxidized Fd
